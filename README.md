adapted from [GameSentenceMiner's wiki](
https://github.com/bpwhelan/GameSentenceMiner/wiki/Overlay-%E2%80%90-Overview#custom-glassy-css-for-yomitan
) to work for light theme as well as various bug fixes (eg. not working on google.com)

todo:
- add setup instructions
- figure out how to bring back the scroll bar without making it look ugly on chromium
- make the light theme look better (lol)
- make it work with shadow set to None on yomitan(?)
